## Lecture #10: Functions, help, input variables continued and debugging

### 1) Update from github

### 2) Review functions -- finish variable input

Function [basics](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/function-basics.html) at MathWorks.

	* Components of a function
	* Building your function's documentation/help
	* Inputs and outputs

### 3) Debugging with breakpoints and stepping

One thing to keep in mind when debugging code is that you can have different kinds of errors (see [this](http://www.wiley.com/college/busin/icmis/oakman/outline/chap05/slides/errors.htm)):

__Syntax Errors and Logical Errors__

1) Syntax errors -- Errors in spelling and grammar.

* You can use the compiler or interpreter to uncover syntax errors.
* You must have a good working knowledge of error messages to discover the cause of the error.

_NOTE: MATLAB has great syntax error catching and highlighting. That is one reason we are using it to teach you how to code._

2) Logical errors -- Errors that indicate the logic used when coding the program failed to solve the problem.

* You do not get error messages with logic errors.
* Your only clue to the existence of logic errors is the production of wrong solutions.

### 4) Different types of functions

	* Anonymous
	* Primary
	* Sub-function
	* Nested
	* Private

### 5) Global variables

### 6) Class exercise: modify your function to use variable input
