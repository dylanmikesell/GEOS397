## Lecture #20: Curve fitting statistics

### 1) Update from github
---
### 2) polyfit, polyval, corrcoef, roots

MATLAB provides several built-in functions to fit curves* Many require the “Curve Fitting Toolbox”, or other toolboxes.
* We will only use the basic curve fitting functions that are part of standard MATLAB
* We will focus on:
	
1) polyfit

2) polyval

3) roots

4) fzero -- to find roots when function is not a polynomial

5) corrcoef
---### 3) Review of polynomials with polyval, polyfit, roots---

### 4) Goodness of fit when finding polynomial coefficients



### 6) Student exercises in class
