### 2) Time series signals

* A time series is an ordered sequence of values
* Sample interval and sampling frequency
* Regular sampling vs. irregular sampling
* Superposition of 1) a periodic component, 2) a long-term component (linear or higher order) and 3) random noise
* Periodic component is a sum of sine (or cosine) waves that have different frequencies and amplitudes
* Nyquist frequency
---### 3) Auto-Spectral Analisys

Auto-spectral analysis aims to describe the distribution of variance contained in a single signal x(t) as a function of frequency or wavelength.

### 4) Cross-Spectral Analysis

### 5) Student Exercise
