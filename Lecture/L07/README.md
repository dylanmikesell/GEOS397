## Lecture #7: Structures/Cells, User I/O (command line and GUI), plotting, mapping toolbox

### 1) Update from github

### 2) Continue lecture 6 file I/O and try-catch

### 3) Structures and cells

Compare these two classes (i.e. data types).

### 4) User I/O -- command line and GUI

MATLAB has a variety of methods to get user input. These are either based on the command line, built-in GUI functions, or you can make custom GUIs. In this lecture we will consider the first two options.

For a list of built-in MATLAB dialog boxes check [this](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/predefined-dialog-boxes.html) site.

### 5) Plotting and figure handles

Figure properties are contained in _Structures_ called __handles__.

### 6) Mapping toolbox

[Getting started](http://www.mathworks.com/help/map/getting-started-with-mapping-toolbox.html) with the [mapping toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/help/map/index.html)
