## Lecture #15: Numerical integration

### 1) Update from github

### 2) Review HW4 solutions

### 3) Matrix plotting and colorbars

__surf()__

__imagesc()__

__colormap()__

__colorbar()__

### 4) Numerical integration

_Numerical integration_ concerns several different tasks, including numerical evaluation of integrals and the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. The term __quadrature__ is often used for the numerical evaluation of a definite integral. Modern quadrature algorithms automatically/adaptively vary integration step size.

1) Midpoint rule

2) Trapezoid rule

3) Simpson's rule

4) Extrapolated Simpson's rule

### 4) Examples and _quadgui_

In these examples we integrate a _function_ over a user specified interval.

### 5) Integration of discrete data (i.e. a vector)

What happens if our function is only known at a finite number of points?

1) Composite trapezoid rule
