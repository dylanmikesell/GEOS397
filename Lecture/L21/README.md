### 2) polyfit, polyval
MATLAB provides several built-in functions to fit curves* Many require the “Curve Fitting Toolbox”, or other toolboxes.
* We will only use the basic curve fitting functions that are part of standard MATLAB
* We will focus on:
	
1) polyfit

2) polyval
---### 3) Review of polynomials with polyval, polyfit
