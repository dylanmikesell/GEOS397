## Lecture #3: Algebra and conditional branching

###1) Using variables: scalars, vectors and matrices

(Chapter 2 in book)

	a) Simple scalar arithmetic (Section 2.1.1)
	b) Order of operations (a.k.a. evaluation) (Section 2.1.2)
	c) Using named variables (Section 2.1.3)
	d) Rules for naming variables (Matlab style guide)
	e) Simple arrays (Section 2.1.6)
	f) Array-scalar and Array-Array Arithmetic (Section 2.1.7)

### 2) Conditional branching

(Chapter 4 in book)

The purpose of relational and logical operators is to provide answers to True/False questions. To represent this idea numerically MATLAB uses a system based on:

True=1 and False=0

	a) Relational testing (<,>,<=,>=,==,~=) (Section 4.1.1)
	b) Logical Operators (&, | , ~) (Section 4.1.2)
	c) Conditional branching If, elseif, else, end (Section 4.1.3)

### 3) In class exercise

	a) Do order of operations exercises

	a) Create an array that starts at 0.0 and ends at the 10.5. Make the array spacing 0.1.
	b) Using relation testing, make a new vector that contains a 1 if the element in your array is less than 5 and a 0 if your element is greater than or equal to 5.
