### 1) Update from github

### 2) INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHMS (3rd Edition)

	"Chapter 1 provides an overview of algorithms and their place in
	modern computing systems. This chapter defines what an algorithm is
	and lists some examples. It also makes a case that we should consider
	algorithms as a technology, alongside technologies such as fast
	hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and
	networks."

### Chapter 1: The role of algorithms in computing
	
#### Section 1.1 Algorithms

Informally, an __algorithm__ is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as __input__ and produces some value, or set of values, as __output__. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.
	
We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a __well-specified computational__ problem. The statement of the problem specifies in general terms the desired input/output relationship. The algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship.
	
#### Section 1.2 Algorithms as technology
